In the era of digital transformation, collaboration between business and scientific institutions is becoming increasingly significant. A striking example of such a partnership is the interaction between "YaCompany" LLC and the University of Artificial Intelligence, resulting in the development of an innovative Neuro-HR system integrated into a Telegram bot.

The project aimed to automate the job matching process for candidates based on JSON resume analysis. This solution not only simplified the resume submission process but also significantly accelerated the selection of relevant vacancies, made possible by advanced AI technologies, including GPT models for data analysis.

The Neuro-HR system automates resume intake, data processing, and job matching, and also generates questions to clarify any missing skills from candidates. As a result, candidates can find suitable jobs faster, while companies can recruit the right specialists more effectively.

Students from the University of Artificial Intelligence actively participated in every stage of the project, allowing them to apply their knowledge and skills to real-world business challenges.
The client, "YaCompany" LLC, expressed high satisfaction with the project results and the effectiveness of the collaboration. Such projects demonstrate the importance and potential of integrating academic research into business processes and highlight the role of innovative approaches in the modern economy.

This partnership opens new horizons for both parties: students gain invaluable experience, while companies gain access to cutting-edge developments in the field of artificial intelligence. This collaboration underscores the significance of combining efforts in science and business to achieve technological progress and economic growth.
