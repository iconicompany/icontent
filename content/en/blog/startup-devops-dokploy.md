**DevOps for Startups: Moving Away from Vercel Without Complicating Things 🛠**

We in the team don't look for easy ways - most of the time we set up "adult" pipelines with deployment to k3s.
It's reliable, scalable, and correct... but for small MVPs at the start, it's often overkill.

Clients regularly ask:

> "We'd like something simpler, but not painful later on."

And here lies the trap.
"Simpler" almost always means **Vercel + Cloud DB**:

* quick start
* minimum effort
* but → vendor lock-in
* and → growing costs with scaling

At the same time, a regular **VPS** is almost always cheaper and gives full control.
There's only one problem - **nobody wants to set up a server manually**.

### Solution: Self-hosted PaaS

We looked into self-hosted PaaS and compared two popular players:

* **Coolify**
* **Dokploy**

🏆 **Our Choice - Dokploy**

Why it appealed to us more than Coolify:

✅ **Interface** - cleaner and more intuitive, less "visual noise"
✅ **Lightweight** - Dokploy itself consumes fewer resources
✅ **Functionality** - monitoring and GitHub integration work "out of the box"

### Our Workflow

We ended up with a simple and reliable scheme:

1️⃣ Project build via **GitHub Actions**
2️⃣ Docker image published to **GHCR (GitHub Container Registry)**
3️⃣ **Dokploy** catches the webhook and automatically updates the container on the VPS

No manual SSH, no magic, no pain.

### Conclusion

We got:

* Vercel-level **convenience**
* **our own VPS** with low cost
* **zero vendor lock-in**
* transparent and controlled deployment

For MVPs and early-stage startups - a **real must-have** if you want fast, cheap, and without future migration headaches.
