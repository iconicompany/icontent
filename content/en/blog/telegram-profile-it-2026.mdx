Recruiters are working massively through Telegram. If your profile is not ready there, you are invisible.

We'll break down how to ensure you are found quickly.

## Why Telegram is everything

Previously, recruiters wrote via email or by phone. Now, searches are increasingly conducted directly in TG:

1. The recruiter searches for you by phone number in Telegram.
2. Didn't find you - searches by name or email in TG.
3. Didn't find you - the candidate is lost, the vacancy goes to someone else.

Your Telegram profile is now your **digital business card** and the main entry point for a recruiter. It's a work tool, not a social network.

## Strict privacy settings

Go to: **Settings → Privacy and Security**

### Who can see my phone number → EVERYONE (or My Contacts)

❌ If set to "Nobody," a recruiter with a number from a database won't find you.

### Who can see my profile photo → EVERYONE

👤 A profile without a photo looks like a bot - zero trust.

### Who can see my last seen time → NOBODY

⏱ Recruiters don't care when you're online. Boundaries are important.

## Profile Content - Your 30-second presentation

### First and Last Name: Real + Profession

⚡ Example: **Ivan Petrov | Python Developer**.

### Username (@username) - most important!

🔑 Searching by full name doesn't always work. A username is your public ID.

Example: `@ivan_petrov_dev` or `@i_petrov_backend`.

💡 **Add it to your resume on HH or LinkedIn.**

### Bio: Briefly about yourself, skills, experience

❌ **Bad:** "Looking for a high-paying job."

✅ **Good:** "Senior Python Developer, 8+ years in e-commerce. Microservices, highload. Open to interesting tasks. Email: ivan@domain.com."

### Profile Photo: Professional, close-up, friendly

### Attached Contacts: Add LinkedIn, HH, GitHub

The recruiter sees everything with one click.

**By the way**, our AI agent Svetlana works exactly the same way. It finds your profile on HH and searches for your TG nickname in it. Didn't find it? It moves on to the next.
