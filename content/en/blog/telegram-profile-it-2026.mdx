Recruiters are massively working through Telegram. If your profile isn't ready there, you're invisible.

We'll break down how to ensure you're found quickly.

## Why Telegram is Key

Recruiters used to write emails or call. Now, searches are increasingly happening directly on TG:

1. The recruiter searches for you by phone number on Telegram.
2. If not found, they search by name or email on TG.
3. If not found, the candidate is lost, and the vacancy goes to someone else.

Your Telegram profile is now your **digital business card** and the main entry point for a recruiter. It's a work tool, not a social network.

## Strict Privacy Settings

Go to: **Settings → Privacy and Security**

### Who can see my phone number → EVERYONE (or My Contacts)

❌ If set to "Nobody," a recruiter with a number from a database won't find you.

### Who can see my profile photo → EVERYONE

👤 A profile without a photo looks like a bot – zero trust.

### Who can see my online time → NOBODY

⏱ Recruiters don't care when you're online. Boundaries are important.

## Profile Content - Your 30-Second Presentation

### First Name and Last Name: Real + Profession

⚡ Example: **Ivan Petrov | Python Developer**.

### Username (@username) - The Most Important!

🔑 Searching by full name doesn't always work. The username is your public ID.

Example: `@ivan_petrov_dev` or `@ipetrov_backend`.

💡 **Add it to your resume on HH or LinkedIn.**

### Bio: Briefly about yourself, skills, experience

❌ **Bad:** "Looking for a high-paying job."

✅ **Good:** "Senior Python Developer, 8+ years in e-commerce. Microservices, highload. Open to interesting tasks. Email: ivan@domain.com."

### Profile Photo: Professional, close-up, friendly

### Pinned Contacts: Add LinkedIn, HH, GitHub

Recruiters see everything with one click.
