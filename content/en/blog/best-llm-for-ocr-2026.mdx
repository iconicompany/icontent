# OCR and VLM 2026: Who Leads in Document Recognition

The OCR and Visual-Language Model (VLM) industry has experienced a real boom in the last few months. It seems you barely get a handle on one novelty before several new players emerge. We've put together a fresh overview and compared the most interesting models to understand who truly deserves a spot in your production pipeline.

## 1. DeepSeek-OCR 2

🐋 **DeepSeek-OCR 2** is a 3B model focused on complex documents and OCR with structure understanding. The main innovation is **DeepEncoder V2**, which works almost like a human: first, a global understanding of the image is formed, and then a logical reading order is established.

**Pros:**

* Excellently handles complex layouts, tables, signatures, and structured text.
* Outperforms Gemini Pro on several benchmarks.
* Can be run locally and fine-tuned via Unsloth.

**Cons:**

* 3B model size → higher GPU requirements for high-frequency inference.

## 2. Step3-VL-10B

🌟 **Step3-VL-10B** from Stepfun.ai is an example of a compact yet "heavy-duty" VLM. With only 10B parameters, it aims to compete with models 10-20 times larger, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and GLM-4.6V.

**Features:**

* 1.8B visual encoder + Qwen3-8B decoder.
* Trained on 1.2 trillion tokens with RLVR+RLHF.
* High results on OCRBench and math task benchmarks.

**Cons:**

* For top scores, PaCoRe = 16 parallel rollouts → x16 computational resources.
* OCR is only part of its capabilities; the primary focus is VLM.

**License:** Apache 2.0
**Links:** vLLM / OpenAI-compatible API

## 3. PaddleOCR-VL-1.5

🐼 **PaddleOCR-VL-1.5** is a compact model (0.9B) optimized for "field" conditions. It was trained considering curved scans, glary photos, and crumpled pages.

**Features:**

* OmniDocBench v1.5 — **94.5% accuracy**.
* Text spotting, seal recognition, table stitching across pages.
* Support for rare languages, Tibetan, and Bengali.
* Easy integration via transformers, Docker, and Paddle.

**Cons:**

* Handwritten text is still poor.
* Page-by-page parsing via transformers is limited.

## 4. GLM-OCR

📄 **GLM-OCR** is a multimodal OCR model with 0.9B parameters. It's based on GLM-V with a CogViT visual encoder and a GLM-0.5B decoder. It supports layout analysis via PP-DocLayout-V3 and parallel recognition.

**Pros:**

* OmniDocBench v1.5 — **94.62% (#1)**.
* Supports tables, formulas, seals, and code-heavy documents.
* Fast inference: vLLM / SGLang / Ollama.
* SDK and simple integration, open-source.

**Cons:**

* JSON schema for Information Extraction requires strict adherence.

## Conclusion

*   **Leaders on OmniDocBench:** GLM-OCR (94.62%) and PaddleOCR-VL-1.5 (94.5%).
*   **Lightest and fastest for production:** PaddleOCR-VL-1.5 and GLM-OCR.
*   **Most "intelligent" architecturally:** DeepSeek-OCR 2 with DeepEncoder V2.
*   **Most versatile VLM:** Step3-VL-10B (OCR is only part of its capabilities).

OCR and VLM have reached a level of maturity that allows for the implementation of document recognition in real production scenarios: from tables and formulas to multi-page PDFs with code and seals. The race for speed, accuracy, and document "understanding" continues.
