# OCR and VLM 2026: Who Leads in Document Recognition

The OCR and Visual-Language Model (VLM) industry has been experiencing a boom for the past few months. It seems you can barely get a handle on one new development before several new players emerge. We've compiled a fresh overview and compared the most interesting models to understand who truly deserves a spot in your production pipeline.

## 1. DeepSeek-OCR 2

🐋 **DeepSeek-OCR 2** is a 3B model focused on complex documents and OCR with structural understanding. Its main innovation is **DeepEncoder V2**, which works almost like a human: it first forms a global understanding of the image and then establishes a logical reading order.

**Pros:**

*   Excellent at handling complex layouts, tables, captions, and structured text.
*   Outperforms Gemini Pro on several benchmarks.
*   Can be run locally and fine-tuned via Unsloth.

**Cons:**

*   3B model size means higher GPU requirements for high-frequency inference.

## 2. Step3-VL-10B

🌟 **Step3-VL-10B** from Stepfun.ai is an example of a compact yet powerful VLM. With only 10B parameters, it aims to compete with models 10–20 times larger, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and GLM-4.6V.

**Features:**

*   1.8B visual encoder + Qwen3-8B decoder.
*   Trained on 1.2 trillion tokens with RLVR+RLHF.
*   High results on OCRBench and mathematical task benchmarks.

**Cons:**

*   For top performance, PaCoRe requires 16 parallel rollouts, demanding 16x computational resources.
*   OCR is only part of its capabilities; the primary focus is VLM.

**License:** Apache 2.0

## 3. PaddleOCR-VL-1.5

🐼 **PaddleOCR-VL-1.5** is a compact model (0.9B) optimized for "field" conditions. It was trained to handle skewed scans, glinting photos, and crumpled pages.

**Features:**

*   OmniDocBench v1.5 — **94.5% accuracy**.
*   Text spotting, stamp recognition, and table stitching across pages.
*   Supports rare languages, Tibetan, and Bengali.
*   Easy integration via transformers, Docker, and Paddle.

**Cons:**

*   Handwritten text is still weak.
*   Per-page parsing via transformers is limited.

## 4. GLM-OCR

📄 **GLM-OCR** is a multimodal OCR model with 0.9B parameters. It is based on GLM-V with a CogViT visual encoder and a GLM-0.5B decoder. It supports layout analysis via PP-DocLayout-V3 and parallel recognition.

**Pros:**

*   OmniDocBench v1.5 — **94.62% (#1)**.
*   Supports tables, formulas, stamps, and code-heavy documents.
*   Fast inference: vLLM / SGLang / Ollama.
*   SDK and simple integration, open-source.

**Cons:**

*   Russian handwritten text is currently a weak point.
*   The JSON schema for Information Extraction requires strict adherence.

## Conclusion

*   **OmniDocBench Leaders:** GLM-OCR (94.62%) and PaddleOCR-VL-1.5 (94.5%).
*   **Lightest and Fastest for Production:** PaddleOCR-VL-1.5 and GLM-OCR.
*   **Most Architecturally "Smart":** DeepSeek-OCR 2 with DeepEncoder V2.
*   **Most Versatile VLM:** Step3-VL-10B (OCR is just part of its capabilities).
*   **Handwritten Text:** Currently, no model excels at reading Russian handwritten text at a high level.

OCR and VLM have reached a level of maturity that allows for the implementation of document recognition in real production scenarios: from tables and formulas to multi-page PDFs with code and stamps. The race for speed, accuracy, and document "understanding" continues.
