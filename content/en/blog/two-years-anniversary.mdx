## 🎉 Today, May 23, 2024, our company turns two years old!

> During this time, we have reached significant heights, launched several successful fintech projects, became **finalists and winners of the IIDF accelerator**, and created our own marketplace for IT specialists. We are proud of our achievements and how far we have come in such a short time.

### 💼 Successful Fintech Projects

From the very beginning, we strived to create innovative solutions in the fintech sector. Our team of developers and analysts works on projects that improve financial processes, making them more efficient and accessible.

Each of our projects was carefully planned and executed with a high level of professionalism, which allowed us to gain recognition in the market.

### 🏆 Victory in the IIDF Accelerator

Participating in the IIDF (Internet Initiatives Development Fund) accelerator became a crucial stage in our development. We not only became finalists but also **won**, which gave us the opportunity to showcase our solutions to a broad audience and attract investor attention. This success confirmed our ability to create innovative products and lead them to success.

### 💻 Launch of the IT Specialist Marketplace

One of our key achievements was the launch of our own marketplace for IT specialists. The platform has become a meeting place for talented developers and companies in need of highly qualified specialists. We strive to provide our users with only the best opportunities for collaboration and growth.

### 🌍 International Orders

Orders on our marketplace are not limited to Russia. Recently, a **client from the UK** joined us with an interesting order regarding castle rentals and event venues. This marked an important step in our international development and served as proof that our services are in demand beyond Russia.

### 🚀 Plans for the Future

Looking ahead, we are setting ambitious goals:

1. **Development of Smart Outstaffing.** We intend to develop the smart outstaffing direction on our platform. This will allow us to provide our clients with the most suitable specialists, considering their specific needs and requirements using artificial intelligence.
2. **Attracting Clients Worldwide.** We are actively working on expanding our client base and attracting customers from all over the world. Our goal is to become a global platform that connects the best IT talents with companies worldwide.

**Our achievements in the first two years are just the beginning.** We are confident that new heights and successes await us. We thank all our partners, clients, and the team for their support and trust. Together, we can achieve even more!
