**Limited Liability Company "YaKompaniya"** (the Platform) offers to conclude this Agreement on the following terms.

## 1. TERMS AND AI SPECIFICS

1.1. **Platform** — Iconicompany software complex that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies for automated task analysis, competency scoring, and team formation.

1.3. **Client** — person ordering works/services from the Platform.

1.4. **Vendor (Subcontractor)** — individual (self-employed), individual entrepreneur or legal entity registered on the Platform to perform work on behalf of the Platform.

## 2. SUBJECT OF AGREEMENT (MODEL CHANGE)

2.1. **General Contracting Model:** The Platform undertakes to perform work (provide services) according to Client Requests. To perform the work, the Platform engages Vendors (Subcontractors).

2.2. **Platform's Role:** In relations with the Client, the Platform acts as the **Contractor**. In relations with the Vendor, the Platform acts as the **Customer**.

2.3. **AI Selection:** The Platform uses AI agents to automatically select and verify Vendors. The Client accepts the candidate proposed by the AI algorithm, after which the Platform enters into a subcontracting agreement with the selected Vendor.

## SECTION I. CONDITIONS FOR VENDORS (SUBCONTRACTORS)

3.1. This section is an Adhesion Contract (Art. 428 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation). The Vendor accepts the terms through registration and checking the box in the interface.

3.2. The Vendor guarantees that they apply a special tax regime (NPD/Self-Employment) or are an individual entrepreneur/legal entity. Loss of the right to the special regime obliges the Vendor to notify the Platform within 1 day.

### 4. WORK ORDER AND AI SCORING
